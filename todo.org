 - Build urls properly so server url username and passowrd can be
   provided
 - Support directory browsing properly rather than hard coding
   Artist/Album/Track order
 - alternatively use the tag browsing api

* Music playing
 - setup using the mpv json ipc for music playing
 - Use the mpv socket to support
   - playlist adding/creating
   - play/pause/skip
   - watch for finish
 - support lastfm scrobbling

* Podcast Support
 - This can be implemented right now pretty easily once mpv tasks are
   done -- or even in its current state
 - Add transient menus for downloading/adding podcasts
