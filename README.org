* subsonic.el
This is a subsonic client for emacs using mpv for music playing.

** Setup
Add a ~~/.authinfo.gpg~ or ~~/.authinfo~ file with the following contents

#+BEGIN_SRC
machine SUBSONIC_URL login USERNAME password PASSSWORD port subsonic
#+END_SRC

The ~port~ section here is used to identify the line as a subsonic
server must be ~subsonic~

If you want to set the default volume set ~mpv-default-volume~

** Usage
Use ~subsonic-artists~ for a browsable list of artists

Use ~subsonic-podcasts~ for a browsable list of podcasts

** Info
This uses some code from docker.el for examples of transient and
tabulated-list-mode as well as the mpv logic from mpv.el

This has only been tested with gonic however it should function with
other servers
